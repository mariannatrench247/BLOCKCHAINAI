Block chain technology and concepts 
•	History of digital asset unalterable and transparent through use of 

Distributed Ledger Tech

Block Chain
	Database stores encrypted blocks of data, chains together. 
	Assets are distributed instead of copied or transferred  immutable record of asset 
•	Digital ledger that can record anything of value 

Asset Decentralized via the Cloud? Or LAN to encourage evolution and learning 
		*** real time access & transparency&&& 

Words are given Keys: Arranged in Lists. 

Tables that arrange keys in relation to association with one another 
	Also in development on how likely they are to occur 
Trained on data and real time 

AI model introduced to tabular data with forms of lists

BC – removes bugs 


Blocks: 
Every chain consists of multiple block and each block has 3 basic element 
	Data in block
	32 bit whole number  nonce : generated randomly when block created, generates block header hash 
	Hash  256 bit number wedded to nonce. Must start with huge number of zeroes
